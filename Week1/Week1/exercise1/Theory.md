Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms
Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial for handling large inventories because:

Speed: Efficient algorithms ensure that operations like adding, updating, and deleting products are performed quickly, which is vital for maintaining a responsive system.
Scalability: Proper data structures help the system scale well with an increasing number of products.
Memory Management: Efficient data structures optimize memory usage, preventing wastage and ensuring the system can handle large amounts of data.
Suitable Data Structures
ArrayList: Good for situations where you need fast access by index and don't perform frequent insertions/deletions.
HashMap: Provides average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups, making it suitable for dynamic and large datasets.
TreeMap: Maintains a sorted order and offers O(log n) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.
For our inventory system, we will use a HashMap due to its efficient average O(1) time complexity for basic operations.












 Analysis
Time Complexity Analysis
Add Product:

Time Complexity: O(1) on average since HashMap provides constant-time complexity for insertions.
Update Product:

Time Complexity: O(1) on average for checking and updating a product in the HashMap.
Delete Product:

Time Complexity: O(1) on average for removing a product from the HashMap.
Optimization Discussion
Load Factor and Rehashing: To ensure the HashMap remains efficient, we need to monitor the load factor (default is 0.75). If the number of products exceeds the threshold, the HashMap will resize itself, which can temporarily degrade performance.

Concurrency Handling: For a multi-threaded environment, consider using ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashMap to handle concurrent modifications efficiently.

This solution provides an efficient and scalable way to manage a warehouse inventory using a HashMap in Java.
