1. Understand Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sort)
Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time. It takes each element from the input data and finds the position it belongs to in the sorted list.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sort)
Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to recursion stack)
Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by dividing the list into equal halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n) (requires additional space for merging)

 Analysis
Performance Comparison
Bubble Sort:

Best Case: O(n) – occurs when the array is already sorted.
Average Case: O(n^2) – occurs when the elements are in random order.
Worst Case: O(n^2) – occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order.
Quick Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n) – occurs when the pivot element divides the array into two equal halves.
Average Case: O(n log n) – typical case for random data.
Worst Case: O(n^2) – occurs when the pivot element is the smallest or largest element (poor pivot choices).
Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred
Efficiency: Quick Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n), which is significantly better than Bubble Sort's O(n^2) for large datasets.
Performance: In practice, Quick Sort is usually faster than Bubble Sort because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures.
Memory Usage: Quick Sort is an in-place sort (although it uses a recursive stack), while other efficient sorts like Merge Sort require additional memory.
