1. Understand Asymptotic Notation
Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's performance as the input size grows. This helps in comparing the efficiency of different algorithms regardless of hardware or software environments.

O(1): Constant time – the algorithm's performance is not affected by the input size.
O(log n): Logarithmic time – performance grows logarithmically with the input size.
O(n): Linear time – performance grows linearly with the input size.
O(n log n): Log-linear time – performance grows log-linearly with the input size.
O(n^2): Quadratic time – performance grows quadratically with the input size.
Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios
Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the fewest number of steps (e.g., finding the element at the first position).
Average Case: The scenario that represents the expected number of steps, averaging all possible inputs.
Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of steps (e.g., element not found or found at the last position).

Time Complexity
Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) – the target is at the first position.
Average Case: O(n) – the target is somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: O(n) – the target is at the last position or not present.
Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) – the target is at the middle position.
Average Case: O(log n) – the array is repeatedly divided in half.
Worst Case: O(log n) – the target is at the farthest position requiring maximum divisions.
Suitability for the Platform
Linear Search:

Suitable for small datasets or unsorted data.
Simple implementation without preprocessing.
Binary Search:

More suitable for larger, sorted datasets.
Requires data to be sorted, which incurs an initial sorting cost (O(n log n)).
Significantly faster than linear search for large datasets due to its O(log n) time complexity.
Considering the need for fast performance in an e-commerce platform, binary search is generally more suitable due to its logarithmic time complexity, provided that the dataset is sorted or can be maintained in a sorted state.
