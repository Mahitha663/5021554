Understand Search Algorithms
Linear Search
Linear search is a straightforward algorithm that checks each element of the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.

Advantages:

Simple to implement.
Does not require the list to be sorted.
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm that repeatedly divides the sorted list in half to locate the target value.

Advantages:

Much faster than linear search for large datasets.
Efficient with a time complexity of O(log n).
Requirements:

The list must be sorted.
Time Complexity: O(log n).

Time Complexity
Linear Search: O(n), where n is the number of books. This means the time taken grows linearly with the number of books.
Binary Search: O(log n), where n is the number of books. This means the time taken grows logarithmically, making it much faster for large datasets.
When to Use Each Algorithm
Linear Search:

Use when the dataset is small or unsorted.
Suitable for one-time searches where sorting overhead is not justified.
Simpler to implement and understand.
Binary Search:

Use when the dataset is large and sorted.
Suitable for repeated searches as the initial sorting cost is offset by faster search times.
More efficient for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
