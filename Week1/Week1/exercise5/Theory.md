Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a data part and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The list starts with a head node and ends with a node whose next reference is null.

Advantages:
Dynamic size: Can grow or shrink in size as needed.
Efficient insertion/deletion: Adding or removing nodes is efficient if the location is known.


Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but each node contains two references: one to the next node and one to the previous node. This allows for traversal in both directions.

Advantages:
Bidirectional traversal: Can be traversed both forwards and backwards.
Easier deletion: Deleting a node is easier as it has a reference to the previous node.

Analysis
Time Complexity
Add: O(n) – Adding a task requires traversing to the end of the list.
Search: O(n) – Searching for a task involves checking each node.
Traverse: O(n) – Traversing the list involves visiting each node.
Delete: O(n) – Deleting a task involves searching for it and adjusting links.
Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays for Dynamic Data
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can easily grow and shrink in size, while arrays have a fixed size.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Insertions and deletions can be done efficiently if the position is known, as they only require changing pointers. In arrays, these operations might require shifting elements.
Memory Usage: Linked lists can be more memory-efficient for sparse data since they do not allocate memory for unused elements, unlike arrays.
Linked lists are suitable for scenarios where the number of elements can change frequently, and efficient insertions and deletions are required. However, they have overhead due to additional pointers and can be less cache-friendly than arrays.
