Array Representation in Memory
Arrays are a data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. This allows for efficient indexing, as the position of any element can be computed given its index and the base address of the array.

Advantages:
Fast Access: Accessing elements by index is O(1) because the address of any element can be directly calculated.
Memory Efficiency: Arrays have minimal overhead since they are stored in contiguous blocks of memory.
Predictable Iteration: Iterating through elements is straightforward due to their contiguous placement.
